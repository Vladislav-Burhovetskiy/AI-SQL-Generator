This is SQL generator, working with openAI!
If you want to use it follow next step:
1. git clone https://github.com/Vladislav-Burhovetskiy/AI-SQL-Generator.git
2. npm i
3. npm run dev
4. npm run dev-node

Attention:
Before you run step 4 "npm run dev-node" you have to fix API_KEY,
because you must use your own API openai KEY! 
- Please follow the link: "https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" and 
- login in and create new secret key, 
- fix the code in index.ts, 
- or add new file .env in the root of your project 
  and put inside new key as a variable API_KEY, but without "";`
  Example: API_KEY=sk-FwCÑ–1sVCejjHChjloXGhT8BlbkFJvLaViqCkZCYP0PUF3mDC;

So, wish you the best;
